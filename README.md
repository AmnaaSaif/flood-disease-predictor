# AI-Powered Flood-Linked Disease Outbreak Predictor

## 🌊 Project Overview

This is an advanced AI system designed to predict disease outbreaks linked to flood events in Pakistan, enabling proactive healthcare response and resource allocation. The system combines satellite data, weather forecasts, and health surveillance to predict outbreaks weeks in advance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Every year, climate change-driven floods in Pakistan trigger massive outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, dengue, and malaria. The 2022 floods affected 33 million people and caused over 1,700 deaths, with disease outbreaks accounting for a significant portion of casualties. The health system typically reacts late, leading to thousands of preventable deaths.

## 🚀 Solution

Our AI-powered system:
- **Predicts disease outbreaks 2-4 weeks in advance** using satellite data and weather patterns
- **Optimizes resource allocation** with AI-driven deployment recommendations  
- **Provides real-time alerts** to health authorities and NGOs
- **Integrates multiple data sources** for comprehensive risk assessment
